1
00:00:02,717 --> 00:00:05,841
All your cars were faster and more expensive than mine.

2
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:08,341
But did you ever beat me, you idiot?

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,716
That's different, because you're nuts.

4
00:00:10,717 --> 00:00:13,437
Did I ever say that my son is normal?

5
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:16,187
Did I ever say that my son is normal?

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:21,850
5. 4. 3...

7
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:25,095
--Go for it!

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:26,580
Go!

9
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,610
Don't wag your tail!!

10
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:50,674
But the AE86 doesn't have the acceleration.

11
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,966
It's OK to lose a little at the beginning.

12
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:56,877
There're less straights and more sharp corners later on.

13
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:59,522
Then my boy is going to show off.

14
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:16,591
The mighty GTR is leading all the way.

15
00:01:16,592 --> 00:01:18,591
The AE86 can't come near it on the straights.

16
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,383
He may catch up on the corners.

17
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,394
but he has no chance to get near the GTR.

18
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,758
They're coming into the curves.

19
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,209
The AE86 is gaining,

20
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:48,549
but the GTR's turns are really precise.

21
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,966
The AE86 has changed tactics! It's starting to drift.

22
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:52,383
They're getting closer at the center of the curve.

23
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,424
The AE86 is attacking those corners fast!

24
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:58,335
The cars almost touched each other
as they drifted out!

25
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:03,799
Is your boy really that good?

26
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,966
A few years ago, my boy told me he needed glasses,

27
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:08,091
so I took him to an optician.

28
00:02:08,092 --> 00:02:10,549
But his eyesight turned out to be 20/20.

29
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,520
I said to him: "Hey, kiddo,

30
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,758
I'll kick your ass if you're playing around!"

31
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,508
And he told me that, when he drives,
everything else

32
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:18,139
gets slower and slower.

33
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:20,967
Only then did I knew

34
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,522
that he was getting faster and faster.

35
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:38,662
"I lost at this corner last time. It won't happen again."

36
00:02:42,717 --> 00:02:44,216
The AE86 is right on the GTR's ass!

37
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:45,097
Unbelievable!

38
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:47,758
The AE86 tried to overtake him,

39
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,849
but the GTR blocked the lane.

40
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:51,954
Hey! That's cheating!!

41
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:53,799
Are you out of your mind??

42
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,133
The AE86 didn't pass him,

43
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,883
but they're getting closer.

44
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:59,264
The AE86 is looking for a chance.

45
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:20,049
If what you said is true, then Takumi will win for sure?

46
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,500
It all depends on...

47
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,409
the last 5... consecutive hairpins.

48
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:44,674
They're at the last 5 hairpins and the AE86
isn't slowing down at all.

49
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:46,755
He can't pass at this speed!

50
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,924
The AE86 has passed the GTR at the inner curve!

51
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:21,299
Can the GTR catch up

52
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,110
at the remaining hairpins?

53
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:36,445
The GTR is slowing down! The AE86 has won!

54
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,466
Some driving style you've got.

55
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:24,877
Weren't you up the hill?
How did you get down here so quick?

56
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:31,052
I heard you went pass him on the ditch. Is it true?

57
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:35,417
I want to race you too. You've got time?

58
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:38,299
I'm sorry. I raced tonight because
my dad asked me to.

59
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,258
I don't think there'll be a next time.

60
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,999
Maybe you'll change your mind tomorrow.

61
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,850
It's done.

62
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,839
I've raised you right. You make me proud...

63
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,739
Hey, come on!

64
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,035
What is it?

65
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,464
Nothing.

66
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:10,712
What's with the towel?

67
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:11,914
It's the sun.

68
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:13,205
Don't be shy.

69
00:07:15,717 --> 00:07:18,267
Is it because I'm wearing a bikini?

70
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:20,007
Of course not.

71
00:07:25,384 --> 00:07:28,064
Where did you get those scars, Takumi?

72
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:30,664
These scars are...

73
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:33,634
They're from my dad.

74
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,049
Dad started drinking after mom left us.

75
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,890
He'd beat me up whenever he's drunk.
Disgusting, huh?

76
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:44,222
I think you look sexier that way.

77
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:48,535
A real man gotta have a few scars on his body.

78
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,959
I can't stand those sissies with smooth skin!

79
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:55,664
I really like this one here.

80
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,937
I got that three years ago.

81
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:01,479
This one is from last week.

82
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:03,239
Does it hurt?

83
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,530
And this one?

84
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:08,855
That's a mosquito bite.

85
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,319
You're such a kidder!

86
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:25,827
We're here.

87
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,966
You're a really good driver, Takumi.

88
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:44,467
I always get carsick on long rides,

89
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:49,285
but I didn't even need to take my pills today.

90
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:51,154
That's good then.

91
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,182
I had a great time today. Thanks a lot.

92
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:56,737
Sure...

93
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:24,057
Bye.

94
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,890
Bye.

95
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:54,364
You know what a god is?

96
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:57,782
A god is human too,

97
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,680
but he can do things other people can't do.

98
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:03,999
So, please save me, God.

99
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:06,564
Please save my car too.

100
00:11:06,717 --> 00:11:07,637
Have a seat.

101
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:21,374
What's with our "world champion", Boss?

102
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:23,939
He just bought an AE86.

103
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:26,747
What about Takumi?

104
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:29,135
That's easy. He's in love.

105
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,379
What's with you today?

106
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:51,542
You wouldn’t get it.

107
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:54,172
Of course I would!

108
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:57,665
You're a man, so it's either cash or chicks.

109
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:06,647
What are we doing here?

110
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:10,229
You said you'd teach me how to drive.

111
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:12,924
When did I say that?

112
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:16,299
Who cares? I'm going to drive downhill
as fast as I can.

113
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,758
Give me a few pointers.

114
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,169
Since I'm smart, I'm sure I can catch on fast.

115
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,775
Let's go then. It's gonna be quick.

116
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,690
Are you buckled up?

117
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:46,484
Car behind you.

118
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:52,924
Why's he driving so fast for?
He can't wait to get laid or what?

119
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:55,775
Turn on the hazard lights. Let him pass.

120
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,100
He hit us!

121
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:08,154
What's with him??

122
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:21,174
Sorry, I thought it was the AE from the tofu shop.

123
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,425
But it's just a piece of junk.

124
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,800
Hey, kids.

125
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:27,758
Shouldn’t you be sleeping at this hour?

126
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,429
Go home and go to bed.

127
00:13:31,884 --> 00:13:32,864
He means you.

128
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:45,635
Did you see his bandanna? He must be gay!

129
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:50,077
I bet you he's looking for boys up there to...

130
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,724
Junk... Total junk.

131
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:18,235
I’ll drive!

132
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:33,525
Say something. What do you have in mind?

133
00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:36,299
Didn't you see that he was trying to kill us?

134
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:36,930
So what?

135
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:41,299
And he said your car is a piece of junk.

136
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,310
Let him say what he wants. We don't care!

137
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,522
Hey, brake...

138
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:47,565
Use the brakes, yo!

139
00:15:00,592 --> 00:15:01,462
The brakes!!

140
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,724
Itsuki, what's with your car?

141
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:05,799
What about it?

142
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:09,341
It doesn't brake when it enters a corner.

143
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,133
All four wheels are off the ground,

144
00:15:11,134 --> 00:15:13,174
and it almost overturns when it exits a corner.

145
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:15,008
So why are you still driving so fast??

146
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:16,929
I gotta catch that asshole.

147
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,350
I wanna go home!! Daddy!!

148
00:15:56,217 --> 00:15:56,797
Daddy!!!

149
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:45,994
Itsuki, are you all right?

150
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:53,989
Are you sure?

151
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,330
OK?

152
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:19,429
Takumi, what have you done?

153
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:24,519
I'm sorry. I wrecked Itsuki's car. I'll pay for it.

154
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:28,015
I'm not talking about that! Do you know

155
00:17:28,092 --> 00:17:31,008
the guy last night is a member
of the Emperor Team?

156
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,869
He's a professional racer.

157
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,610
You've beaten his EVO with this piece of junk.

158
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:39,442
Are you out of your mind?

159
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:41,924
But it's exactly the same car as my dad's.

160
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:43,674
How could it be the same?

161
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:47,049
Your dad has spent so much time and effort
on his car.

162
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,950
It took him a month just to find
the right suspension!

163
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:52,883
This piece of crap here?

164
00:17:52,884 --> 00:17:57,074
Only an idiot like my boy would get conned
into buying it!

165
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:00,025
Where's Itsuki?

166
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:09,758
Some "world champion" he is.
One spin and he's been puking nonstop.

167
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,669
You know any other guy that gets carsick?

168
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:18,384
You're different, Takumi.

169
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:21,341
You have a chance to become an ace racer
one day.

170
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:22,202
Keep it up.

171
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:30,057
Hey.

172
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:35,799
What? You dropped your money?

173
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:42,092
The suspension. Did it really take you
one month to fix it?

174
00:18:48,217 --> 00:18:49,137
Why so long?

175
00:18:49,717 --> 00:18:51,758
It's not just the suspension.

176
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,174
I had to test the tires, the brakes,

177
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,335
drive train, balance between front and rear...

178
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:59,499
A month was about right.

179
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:04,227
Is it really fun being a racer?

180
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:07,337
Why? You wanna be one?

181
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:09,347
I dunno.

182
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:11,009
You dunno?

183
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:14,059
Then come on in and help make tofu!

184
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:16,466
Your friend's been helping me for the whole afternoon.

185
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:17,217
My friend?

186
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:27,927
You don't have to do that!

187
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,197
It's no trouble at all.

188
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:32,197
Please have some tea, Uncle.

189
00:19:33,134 --> 00:19:36,494
The tofu is all done. I made some dim sum too.

190
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:37,945
Thanks.

191
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:39,234
You're welcome.

192
00:19:41,884 --> 00:19:43,334
Takumi! You're back!

193
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:45,319
How come you're here?

194
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,940
Look who's talking!

195
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:52,924
You haven't called me once since our last date,

196
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,535
so I came to see you.

197
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:57,049
Natsuki, where's the dim sum?

198
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,600
I'll get it for you.

199
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:10,584
It's so nice having a girl in the house.

200
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:13,716
Especially with a skirt like that!

201
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:16,157
If only it's two inches shorter...

202
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:24,109
You should’ve called me first.

203
00:20:24,384 --> 00:20:26,354
I called you lots of times,

204
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,258
but either you're at work or you're asleep.

205
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:30,989
Your dad is a nice guy.

206
00:20:31,134 --> 00:20:32,684
He ain't a nice guy.

207
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,920
But I've talked to him on the phone a lot.

208
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:39,341
He really cares about you, did you know that?

209
00:20:39,342 --> 00:20:41,892
You've talked to him on the phone?!

210
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,674
Something wrong with that?

211
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:44,885
What did he say?

212
00:20:46,384 --> 00:20:48,934
Uncle told me you wanna be a racer.

213
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:53,505
I never said that.

214
00:20:54,634 --> 00:20:57,549
He also told me that, if you try hard enough,

215
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,570
you'll one day become a world class racer.

216
00:21:03,425 --> 00:21:05,225
Someone once told me that

217
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:10,174
the most important thing is to find a world to belong to.

218
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:13,675
Only then will we realize that life is meaningful.

219
00:21:14,634 --> 00:21:18,014
Takumi... I think for you, that world is racing.

220
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:21,464
Who told you that?

221
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:25,757
My...my uncle.

222
00:21:29,092 --> 00:21:29,902
Your uncle?

223
00:21:32,217 --> 00:21:34,077
Ever since my father died,

224
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,440
he's been taking care of me and my mom.

225
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,424
I thought it was my dad.

226
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:45,579
I knew he couldn’t be that deep.

227
00:21:46,842 --> 00:21:48,992
So who is this uncle, Natsuki?

228
00:22:16,592 --> 00:22:20,633
"The most important thing is to find a world to belong to.

229
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:24,134
Only then will we realize that life is meaningful.

230
00:22:33,592 --> 00:22:35,272
If you try hard enough,

231
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:38,529
you'll one day become a world class racer.

232
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:51,699
Takumi... I think for you, that world is racing."

233
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,950
You deliver tofu at this hour?

234
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,216
Something wrong with your car?

235
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:16,677
Wrong?

236
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:19,224
I'm tuning it.

237
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,490
I said I wanna race you, remember?

238
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:24,694
I never said I would.

239
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:28,669
If I ask you now, would you say yes?

240
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:34,591
I wanna ask you...Coordinating the suspension
and the tires...

241
00:23:34,592 --> 00:23:36,549
Does it really take a whole month?

242
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,300
- You wanna know? - Yeah.

243
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,924
First, the engine. It's crucial to
increase the barometer of the turbocharger,

244
00:23:41,925 --> 00:23:44,258
but you gotta keep an eye on the input air volume.

245
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:46,133
And the exhaust valve needs to match it too.

246
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:48,466
Suspension has to be tuned based on hardness,
shock absorption,

247
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:51,049
the tires' size and their angle to the road,

248
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,720
plus the lower arm bar and tower bar.

249
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:57,624
Then you fine-tune it based on the computer data.

250
00:23:58,634 --> 00:24:00,264
Your dad is incredible.

251
00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:05,067
If I were to retune it, it would take me
at least 6 months.

252
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:09,459
Your car has been tuned to its optimal level.

253
00:24:09,634 --> 00:24:10,564
Simply put...

254
00:24:11,925 --> 00:24:12,905
It's perfect.

255
00:24:16,342 --> 00:24:18,633
So my old man is really that good.

256
00:24:18,634 --> 00:24:21,024
However, every car has its limits.

257
00:24:21,717 --> 00:24:25,027
One day, you're gonna want more from your car.

258
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:27,144
Just get another one.

259
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,049
But I only like my AE86.

260
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:32,884
So, when's our race?

261
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:34,887
3 weeks from now. Saturday.

262
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:36,762
Why so long?

263
00:24:39,092 --> 00:24:42,812
You said it took 3 weeks
to retune your car, right?

264
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:05,077
That's him!

265
00:25:05,134 --> 00:25:05,704
Got it.

266
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,008
Be careful. He's very fast on the corners.

267
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:37,679
So? It's just an AE86.

268
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:07,995
You OK?

269
00:28:24,842 --> 00:28:27,758
I forgot to tell you. This is just a tofu delivery car.

270
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:29,719
You can't race us in this.

271
00:28:29,884 --> 00:28:31,854
You could get hurt, got it?

272
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,570
That's right. You guys are professional racers.

273
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,232
Of course you look down on us street racers.

274
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,520
Professional or street doesn't matter.
We're all racers.

275
00:28:47,217 --> 00:28:49,827
Right, you beat me once, didn't you?

276
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:52,980
You remember?

277
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,710
Wanna win again?

278
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,010
Sure, call me. You have my team's number.

279
00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:00,634
Is the AE87 out yet?

280
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:03,939
It's up to AE89 already, I think.

281
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:45,259
Just talking, no hitting.

282
00:29:45,342 --> 00:29:48,716
Hitting your kid in public will be very traumatic to him.

283
00:29:48,717 --> 00:29:49,877
Shut your mouth!

284
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:55,709
Tofuman...

285
00:29:57,134 --> 00:29:58,884
Just talking, no hitting.

286
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:03,487
Hitting your kid in public will be very traumatic to him.

287
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:06,534
I'm going home.

288
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:35,339
Are you still upset about losing?

289
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:39,383
I challenged Kyouichi, the guy who beat you,

290
00:30:39,384 --> 00:30:40,994
to a race in 3 weeks.

291
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:43,984
You're invited.

292
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:48,419
If you don't have another car, I do.

293
00:30:51,592 --> 00:30:54,612
Thanks, but I only wanna drive my own car.

294
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,079
Call me if you change your mind.

295
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:25,912
Want some cheesecake? It's delicious!

296
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,720
Natsuki brought it for you.

297
00:31:31,675 --> 00:31:33,005
When was she here?

298
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:41,995
She's going away for a couple of weeks,
but she'll call you later.

299
00:31:44,925 --> 00:31:46,545
What else did she say?

300
00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:52,832
Was she supposed to say something else?

301
00:32:00,842 --> 00:32:01,592
Hey! Hey!!

302
00:32:03,425 --> 00:32:05,299
You're gonna eat the whole cake??

303
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,510
You'll stuff yourself to death!

304
00:33:11,092 --> 00:33:13,952
Tofuman, your AE86 is already an antique.

305
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,619
Might as well switch to a new car. Why fix it?

306
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:22,508
Don't tell me you gonna put THAT
into the AE86?!

307
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:24,009
Isn't this a beauty?

308
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:30,899
But this is a race car engine.
You wanna go to jail?!

309
00:33:33,675 --> 00:33:34,595
You're nuts.

310
00:34:00,717 --> 00:34:02,417
Catching roaches, Itsuki?

311
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:04,924
No, looking for my old man.

312
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:07,549
He's been gone for days, just like you.

313
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,190
Customer.

314
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:12,175
That sucks. He's not young anymore.

315
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:15,216
He can't just leave his business like this.
That's irresponsible!

316
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:17,508
What'll happen to me if it goes bankrupt??

317
00:34:17,509 --> 00:34:20,258
It's good that I've been living on my own,

318
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:22,769
otherwise I wouldn’t be this chubby.

319
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,820
Boss?! What happened??

320
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,520
Uncle, what did you do now?

321
00:34:46,842 --> 00:34:49,332
We went for a spin at Mount Akina.

322
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:53,284
Is he down yet?

323
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:54,445
Coming.

324
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:05,707
Sounded like a high rpm.

325
00:36:06,175 --> 00:36:09,715
But when it's entering the corner, it's too slow.

326
00:37:01,009 --> 00:37:01,579
Hop in.

327
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:13,466
I’ll only show you once.

328
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:17,097
Watch carefully. Pay attention to the new tachometer.

329
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,716
Its power won't become obvious

330
00:37:22,717 --> 00:37:24,857
until it's above 11,000 revs.

331
00:37:55,342 --> 00:37:57,612
Sit tight. I wanna drive faster.

332
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:16,779
Miya...

333
00:38:18,634 --> 00:38:21,324
That Kaiseki dinner was delicious, huh?

334
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:22,514
Not bad.

335
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:24,345
That's good.

336
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:26,966
Thanks so much for taking care of me

337
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:29,508
while I puked for two days straight.

338
00:38:29,509 --> 00:38:32,179
You were like a goddess who saved me.

339
00:38:36,384 --> 00:38:37,304
You're nuts.

340
00:38:37,592 --> 00:38:38,512
I'm serious.

341
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,630
I believe in gods.

342
00:38:41,842 --> 00:38:43,282
A god is human too,

343
00:38:43,717 --> 00:38:46,716
but he can do things other humans can't do.

344
00:38:46,717 --> 00:38:48,437
That's why he's a god.

345
00:38:49,384 --> 00:38:50,884
But do you know that

346
00:38:51,592 --> 00:38:54,782
a god also have the same urges as us humans?

347
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,424
What're you trying to say?

348
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:01,825
Most humans would...

349
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:04,109
sometimes go to

350
00:39:06,634 --> 00:39:08,204
this love hotel and...

351
00:39:08,717 --> 00:39:10,424
Since you're also in the "fill it up" business,

352
00:39:10,425 --> 00:39:12,925
Miya, I'm sure you wouldn’t mind...

353
00:39:17,009 --> 00:39:17,589
Pervert!

354
00:39:31,342 --> 00:39:31,982
Natsuki?!

355
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,044
What the hell..?

356
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:51,634
I test-drove with my dad yesterday.

357
00:39:51,717 --> 00:39:54,327
Turns out it's got a new tachometer.

358
00:39:54,342 --> 00:39:56,049
I just found out yesterday.

359
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,100
Imagine. AE86, 250 horsepower.

360
00:40:00,842 --> 00:40:02,922
You know how fast is 250 hp?

361
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,784
I did Mount Akina at 150kph...

362
00:40:08,092 --> 00:40:10,924
It only took me a little more than 3 minutes.

363
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:11,855
Amazing, huh?

364
00:40:14,342 --> 00:40:16,852
I really wanna tell everyone. You...

365
00:40:18,592 --> 00:40:19,462
and Natsuki.

366
00:40:22,759 --> 00:40:23,389
No need.

367
00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:25,529
No need for what?

368
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,207
No need to tell Natsuki.

369
00:40:32,634 --> 00:40:33,154
Takumi.

370
00:40:35,384 --> 00:40:38,994
There's something I... I wanna tell my best friend.

371
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:40,035
Who's that?

372
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:41,224
You.

373
00:40:42,175 --> 00:40:42,865
Go ahead.

374
00:40:49,509 --> 00:40:50,669
I saw Natsuki...

375
00:40:53,842 --> 00:40:56,392
Going into a love hotel with a guy.

376
00:40:58,134 --> 00:41:00,004
--Love hotel? --Love hotel.

377
00:41:00,342 --> 00:41:01,322
Are you sure?

378
00:41:04,384 --> 00:41:07,104
It only costs 30,000 yen to bang her.

379
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,612
What did you say?

380
00:41:15,425 --> 00:41:17,155
30,000 yen to bang her!

381
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:19,379
Your girl is a hooker!

382
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:24,924
What're you talking about??

383
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:26,966
I'm trying to help you and you hit me?!

384
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:27,827
Go to hell!

385
00:41:28,425 --> 00:41:32,245
I've known you since 7 and you hit me over a whore??

386
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:34,602
Don't!

387
00:41:46,675 --> 00:41:47,305
Stop it!

388
00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:48,864
Come, hit me!

389
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,320
Go ahead, hit me!

390
00:41:56,884 --> 00:41:58,044
Takumi, stop it!

391
00:41:59,175 --> 00:42:00,035
Let's talk!

392
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,230
Why fighting?

393
00:42:05,592 --> 00:42:06,632
Pull him back!

394
00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:10,072
Stop it, boy!

395
00:42:12,217 --> 00:42:13,327
Stop fighting...

396
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:16,654
Takumi!

397
00:42:20,384 --> 00:42:22,049
Why did you hit him, you jerk?!

398
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,170
That's right, I'm a jerk! I jerk off too!!

399
00:43:06,175 --> 00:43:07,325
Hello? It's me.

400
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:12,140
I shouldn’t have called your girl a whore.
I'm sorry.

401
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,440
Did you forget? Today is Saturday.

402
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,770
Everyone is waiting for you and your AE86.

403
00:44:50,675 --> 00:44:51,135
Hello.

404
00:44:51,425 --> 00:44:51,885
Hello?

405
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:52,772
It's me.

406
00:44:53,384 --> 00:44:54,184
What's up?

407
00:44:54,467 --> 00:44:56,008
I've been looking for you.

408
00:44:56,009 --> 00:44:57,859
I've been in my hometown.

409
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,840
I'm boarding the train now. I'll be back tonight.

410
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:04,383
I'm racing at Mount Akina tonight.

411
00:45:04,384 --> 00:45:06,383
I'll come see you right after the race, OK?

412
00:45:06,384 --> 00:45:09,591
No...Why don't I come see you tomorrow instead?

413
00:45:09,592 --> 00:45:11,216
The train is here. Talk to you later.

414
00:45:11,217 --> 00:45:13,487
Natsuki, I really wanna see you.

415
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:19,005
Natsuki.

416
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:24,542
I've really enjoyed your company
this past 2 weeks, thanks.

417
00:45:25,384 --> 00:45:28,114
Did I give you enough money last time?

418
00:45:30,592 --> 00:45:34,602
It's better that we don't see each other
after tonight.

419
00:45:39,217 --> 00:45:41,767
I don't wanna be like this anymore.

420
00:45:42,884 --> 00:45:47,354
I don't wanna see you again.
I want to forget about all this.

421
00:45:48,009 --> 00:45:50,669
All I want now is to be with Takumi.

422
00:46:11,217 --> 00:46:13,549
Isn't it a bit too much, broomhead?

423
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,060
I know Ryousuke well.

424
00:46:17,592 --> 00:46:20,202
I will never lose to the same guy...

425
00:46:22,092 --> 00:46:22,552
twice.

426
00:46:29,217 --> 00:46:32,107
Shit, I hope I didn't hurt him too bad.

427
00:46:34,217 --> 00:46:35,377
You should talk.

428
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:40,587
Your nose has been bleeding for days.

429
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:43,582
See? There you go again.

430
00:46:46,342 --> 00:46:49,902
Will this become a monthly thing
like your period?

431
00:46:55,509 --> 00:46:58,216
What're we waiting for?? Everyone's here!

432
00:46:58,217 --> 00:46:59,427
What's the rush?

433
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,590
I'll give him 5 minutes.

434
00:47:01,759 --> 00:47:06,419
Doesn't really matter if he comes.
Tonight is between you and me.

435
00:47:11,842 --> 00:47:15,299
Block the road. The race will begin in 5 minutes.

436
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,920
Wait! A car is coming!

437
00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:29,349
It's the AE86!

438
00:47:38,425 --> 00:47:42,008
We never had so many girls at our races back then!

439
00:47:42,009 --> 00:47:42,989
That's right.

440
00:47:43,175 --> 00:47:46,485
This is a ladies-only zone, pops. Take a hike.

441
00:47:57,384 --> 00:47:58,304
It's coming!

442
00:48:14,675 --> 00:48:17,585
So you've resurrected this piece of junk?

443
00:48:17,884 --> 00:48:19,384
Way to go, tofu boy!

444
00:48:20,592 --> 00:48:23,612
And where's your car, the one you crashed?

445
00:48:24,009 --> 00:48:26,099
Tofu boy, you wanna go first?

446
00:48:27,259 --> 00:48:30,919
No need. Just drive fast. I got other things to do.

447
00:48:33,384 --> 00:48:34,134
Wear this.

448
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,430
No need.

449
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:38,841
Ryousuke's got something to tell you.

450
00:48:38,842 --> 00:48:41,772
Listen, Takumi. Kyouichi is a professional,

451
00:48:42,467 --> 00:48:44,591
but all professionals have their weaknesses...

452
00:48:44,592 --> 00:48:47,299
You don't need to teach me. I'm gonna beat him.

453
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,340
What about me?

454
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:49,764
I'll beat you too.

455
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:32,782
The road is clear. We can start at any time.

456
00:49:33,009 --> 00:49:35,389
Repeat: We can start at any time.

457
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:37,770
5!

458
00:49:38,634 --> 00:49:38,854
4!

459
00:49:39,675 --> 00:49:39,895
3!

460
00:49:40,759 --> 00:49:40,979
2!

461
00:49:41,842 --> 00:49:42,062
1!

462
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:43,307
GO!!

463
00:49:55,884 --> 00:49:57,008
All three cars took off at top speed.

464
00:49:57,009 --> 00:49:58,133
Kyouichi's E3 is leading,

465
00:49:58,134 --> 00:49:59,341
followed by Ryousuke's FC.

466
00:49:59,342 --> 00:50:00,612
The AE86 is last.

467
00:50:16,592 --> 00:50:17,758
They've past the first corner.

468
00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:20,216
Both Ryousuke and Takumi made their best
lap time.

469
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:23,357
Everyone's faster when they're racing a pro.

470
00:50:46,884 --> 00:50:48,274
What are you doing?

471
00:50:48,342 --> 00:50:49,799
This is called "strategy".

472
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,383
The FC suddenly lags behind right before the tunnel.

473
00:50:51,384 --> 00:50:53,884
I wonder what Ryousuke had in mind?

474
00:51:24,217 --> 00:51:25,216
The speed is unbelievable!

475
00:51:25,217 --> 00:51:27,049
All three cars exceeded 100 kph at the corner just now!

476
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,133
The AE86 is waiting for a chance

477
00:51:28,134 --> 00:51:30,091
to overtake the E3 at the next corner.

478
00:51:30,092 --> 00:51:31,542
Step on it, Takumi!!

479
00:51:32,259 --> 00:51:33,716
Give it back! What's wrong with you??

480
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:36,557
What's wrong with YOU?? This is a race!

481
00:51:36,884 --> 00:51:38,794
You gotta yell at a race!!

482
00:52:08,134 --> 00:52:08,994
This is it.

483
00:52:21,967 --> 00:52:23,008
They overtook him!

484
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:24,174
The E3 has hardly any room and

485
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:25,674
both the FC and AE86 used the ditch

486
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:26,633
to overtake the E3!

487
00:52:26,634 --> 00:52:28,614
Let me explain, little girl.

488
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,716
In street racing, a professional’s common weakness

489
00:52:31,717 --> 00:52:34,383
is to leave some open space when taking a right corner.

490
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:35,774
Step on it, Takumi!

491
00:52:41,175 --> 00:52:42,758
Takumi, it's just you and me now.

492
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:43,966
What about the E3?

493
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:45,174
I'll block it for you.

494
00:52:45,175 --> 00:52:47,035
Better watch your own ass.

495
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:02,008
The AE86 and FC both managed to pass a pro!

496
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:03,469
Who could’ve thought?

497
00:53:03,925 --> 00:53:05,674
But the E3 is not out of it yet!

498
00:53:05,675 --> 00:53:07,133
Although they use different tactics,

499
00:53:07,134 --> 00:53:08,883
the FC and AE86 are way too fast

500
00:53:08,884 --> 00:53:10,394
in the corner drifts.

501
00:53:10,425 --> 00:53:13,095
Catching up to them will not be easy.

502
00:53:21,634 --> 00:53:23,024
Step on it, Takumi!

503
00:54:13,634 --> 00:54:14,984
Attention, everyone!

504
00:54:15,384 --> 00:54:17,799
A vehicle has just left the national park

505
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,174
and it's heading up the mountain!

506
00:54:19,175 --> 00:54:22,895
A car is coming towards you. Get ready to slow down!

507
00:54:26,967 --> 00:54:30,997
Kyouichi is ignoring the warning! He's trying to overtake!

508
00:54:35,967 --> 00:54:37,417
Should we block him?

509
00:54:37,884 --> 00:54:38,574
Too late.

510
00:55:00,842 --> 00:55:02,924
The E3 has crashed! The E3 has crashed!

511
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:06,091
The AE86 and FC passed through. They're still racing!

512
00:55:06,092 --> 00:55:06,832
Is he OK?

513
00:55:07,175 --> 00:55:07,985
Forget him.

514
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:13,912
Kyouichi! Are you OK??

515
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,008
They're at the 5 consecutive hairpins.

516
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,569
Can the FC pass here?

517
00:56:09,842 --> 00:56:11,508
"The AE86 is at its Limits.

518
00:56:11,509 --> 00:56:12,889
Now it's my turn."

519
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,410
The FC overtakes the AE86!

520
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:24,591
There's only 1km left!

521
00:56:24,592 --> 00:56:25,966
I don't think the AE86 can make it.

522
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:27,067
What the hell?!

523
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,350
I knew it.

524
00:56:29,217 --> 00:56:30,049
You knew what??

525
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,790
Takumi has never taken the lead before.

526
00:56:32,967 --> 00:56:35,966
Ryousuke's car is powerful, but he still
stayed behind Takumi

527
00:56:35,967 --> 00:56:40,047
because he wants to learn his moves and then overtake him.

528
00:56:40,092 --> 00:56:41,508
So it's over for Takumi?

529
00:56:41,509 --> 00:56:42,619
Not necessarily.

530
00:56:54,884 --> 00:56:58,008
You've been driving by yourself all these years.

531
00:56:58,009 --> 00:57:00,216
You've never competed with anyone.

532
00:57:00,217 --> 00:57:00,857
Remember.

533
00:57:02,717 --> 00:57:05,927
Don't pay attention to the competition itself.

534
00:57:06,842 --> 00:57:08,242
Ignore other racers.

535
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,179
The one you need to beat is yourself.

536
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,883
They're almost at the finish line and the
AE86 hasn't given up yet!

537
00:57:23,884 --> 00:57:26,144
It's still right behind the FC.

538
00:57:36,092 --> 00:57:38,299
The FC missed its lane going into the corner!

539
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,633
Can Ryousuke withstand the pressure from the AE86?

540
00:57:40,634 --> 00:57:42,549
The "pressure" comes from the tires.

541
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:44,508
Even though the car is retuned to 250 hp,

542
00:57:44,509 --> 00:57:46,599
the FC is still too powerful.

543
00:57:46,634 --> 00:57:49,549
But as time drags on, the tires won't hold up,

544
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,508
and the car can't drift all the way.

545
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:55,749
That's why the last 2 corners are the most
crucial of all!

546
00:57:56,092 --> 00:57:57,252
There they come!

547
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,049
They're almost at the finish line!

548
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:34,966
The mighty FC still has the edge.

549
00:58:34,967 --> 00:58:37,237
Looks like the outcome is clear.

550
00:58:50,217 --> 00:58:52,717
The FC slows going into the corner!

551
00:58:52,759 --> 00:58:56,429
The AE86 is taking the inner lane.
Can it overtake?

552
00:59:11,467 --> 00:59:12,591
The AE86 has won!!

553
00:59:12,592 --> 00:59:16,202
The AE86 is the ultimate
racing god of Mount Akina!

554
00:59:25,884 --> 00:59:27,564
All right!! He did it!!

555
00:59:38,467 --> 00:59:39,097
He won!!

556
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,767
I've lost.

557
01:00:10,675 --> 01:00:12,415
So, what now? Any plans?

558
01:00:13,134 --> 01:00:14,824
Nothing. What about you?

559
01:00:14,967 --> 01:00:18,797
I'm gonna set up a new race team.
Are you interested?

560
01:00:21,717 --> 01:00:22,877
Dunno. Gotta go.

561
01:00:23,384 --> 01:00:26,054
Takumi! I really want you on my team.

562
01:00:27,425 --> 01:00:28,345
Sleep on it.

563
01:00:31,509 --> 01:00:32,309
We'll see.

564
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:02,154
Takumi!

565
01:02:07,217 --> 01:02:08,327
Takumi! Takumi!

566
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:10,799
"The most important thing is
to find a world to belong to."

567
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,300
"Only then will we realize that life is meaningful."

568
01:03:15,175 --> 01:03:18,615
"Takumi... I think for you, that world is racing."

569
01:04:15,009 --> 01:04:16,399
Well? Did you lose?

570
01:04:16,842 --> 01:04:17,532
Hey. Hey!

571
01:04:18,384 --> 01:04:19,824
Let's have a drink!

572
01:04:42,675 --> 01:04:43,825
Son of a bitch.

573
01:04:44,925 --> 01:04:46,255
Itsuki, I'm sorry.

574
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:58,635
Hey, Ryousuke. It's me, Takumi.

575
01:05:01,884 --> 01:05:02,224
I...

576
01:05:03,717 --> 01:05:05,677
I want to be on your team.
